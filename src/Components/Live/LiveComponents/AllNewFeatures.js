                    <h1>MIDI Transformations</h1>
                    <p>Create a variety of simple or complex variations to your MIDI clips: add ornaments and articulations, draw acceleration and deceleration curves, connect successive notes and chords, or simulate the strum of a guitar.</p>

                    <p>Max now facilitates even greater experimentation, letting you create new MIDI Transformations and Generators – either based on existing ones, or your own creations.</p>
                    <h1>Keys and Scales</h1>
                    <p>Set the selected clip’s scale in Live’s Control Bar to see its notes in any clip you create. Then edit the clip using scale highlighting as a guide, use the clip scale to transform and generate musical ideas, or sync the scale of MIDI devices and instruments to the clip being played. Any changes in Live will be reflected in Push, and vice versa.</p>
                    <h1>Embrace and explore tunings</h1>
                    <p>Follow your preferred tuning systems or try different ones more easily. Work outside the 12-tone equal temperament system, and access tunings with Live’s devices as well as any MPE-capable plugin.</p>

                        Arrange the order of a selection of notes by pitch, velocity or duration. Stretch, split, chop or join notes in new ways; shape the velocity of notes; transpose them into a scale; or add intervals chromatically or in key.

                    Assign a single probability rule to a group of notes so that the entire group of notes is played whenever the trigger is fired. Or select a chord and tell Live to randomly play one note from it whenever the probability trigger is fired.
